# Diabetic_Retinopathy_Segmentation_Using_UNet

I have used 4 different UNet Models to assess and compare to find out best model.<br>
The dataset is the [High Resolution Fundus Image (HRF) Dataset](https://www5.cs.fau.de/research/data/fundus-images/)

The models used are:
- Simple UNet Model
- Attention UNet Model: With gating signals
- Residual UNet Model: With skip connections
- Residual-Attention UNet Model: With skip and gating blocks
